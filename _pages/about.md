Welcome! I am a Post-doctoral Research Associate at [Lehigh University Energy Research Center](https://www.lehigh.edu/energy/). In December 2023, I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/), where I had the privilege of being mentored by Dr. Carlos Romero and Dr. Ganesh Balasubramanian. 

My research interests include thermal management, energy storage, heat transfer, machine learning, and molecular dynamics. My work seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, focusing on enhancing energy efficiency, optimizing thermal systems, and pioneering next-generation energy storage solutions. Whether you're in academia, industry, or at the nexus of both, I am keen on exploring collaborative opportunities that drive forward our shared goal of technological advancement and sustainability.

Let's connect and innovate together!
